title: Medical Haematology ABO Blood Group Determination
---
With use of the ABO- and Rhesus-D system for blood-type categorisation; determination was implemented in accordance to the ELDONCARD 2521 method of blood typing. As an example, the erythrocytic membrane of the Group-O negative blood is absent in regards to the expression of gylcoproteins, such as: antigeen A, B, and D; therefore we should expect no agglutination between the blood-donor and the reagents particular to each circular field, the opposite would occur with Group-AB positive blood - apart from the control. Furthermore, determination of blood type suitability purposed for transfusion or transplantation is dependent upon the identification and compatibility between blood types.

# Methods

The card is composed of four circular fields. One of the circular fields is a a control to ensure test validity. The three other circular fields are labelled: Anti-A, Anti-B, and Anti-D; labelling the contained corresponding monoclonal antibodies of each field. Use of the Eldoncard went as follows, saturation of the circular fields, then the blood-donor prepares the sterilised finger, then using the lancet prick, releases the needle at the finger-tip so that the blood is exposed, then appyling the blood to the circular fields - making sure not to cross-contamainate - with the use of the four EldonSticks. Once application is complete, through correct methods of mixing with the EldonStick, and the card rotations and time duration, the blood-fields finally demonstrate the presence or absence of agglutination.

# Results and Discussion

The test results can be found in 'pending figure'. As there was no appearance of agglutination in the control field, the test is deemed valud. There was an occurence of agglutination in fields Anti-A, meaning the blood donor embodies type A antigens on the erythrocytic surface. Thirdly, there was an absence of blood agglutination in the Anti-B field, as there likely exists a presence of Anti-B antibodies in the tested plasma, so no cause for haemolytic agglutination. Lastly, agglutination occurred in field Anti-D; therefore, the blood tested is Rh-positive due to the presence of the non-glysoylated proteins present on the erythrocytic surface, in this case antigen D. The result of the test suggests the blood donor is A-positive.

identifiable differences within each blood types can be categorised by the ABO-system, with further distinguishment through the Rhesus-system. This harbours significance with regards to blood transfusions and transplantation where there is the potential for haemolytic reactions due to the incompatibility between certain erythrocytic antigens and relevant antibodies of the plasma serum. And it is paramount that before any form of blood therapy occurs, blood-type identification in conjunction to correct prepratory methods, such as: cross-matching, is conducted (Mitra et al, 2014). Once the blood-type has been defined, cross-matching is a preliminary method to transfusion/transplantation, which involves the mixing of donor blood with the plasma serum of the recipient so that ant related complement-mediated haemolysis is detected. Blood-typing is also possible through mixing whole-blood and anti-sera which is obtained via the isolation of plasma antibodies, testing for the same agglutination processes.

For instance, the blood donor tested in this study, of whom is blood-type A, would not be able to donate blood to any recipient that carrieds Anti-A antibodies, which would include blood-types: B and O. Only A and AB blood-types would be able to recieve A-type blood, as neither carry Anti-A antibodies. Furthermore, AB blood-types have no antibodies against A or B blood-types, making AB blood-types the univeral recipient; whereas O blood-types have both Anti-A and Anti-B present in the plasma, therefore are considered as a universal donor, as neither A or B antigen is present so hyperacute rejection regarding the recipient is unlikey, although differences in antibody concentrations should be accounted for in non-recipients (Godin et al, 2016; Camp et al, 1967).

However, this does not consider the Rhesus-system, where a D-negative recipient of D-positive blood, who was previously unexposed to the D antigen, could potentially trigger intravascular haemolysis through developing anti-Rh D antibodies. This is particularly dangerous in the relationship between a D-negative mother developing anti-Rh D antibodies because of birthing a paternally inherited D-positive blood-type baby; therefore posing a risk of aborting future subsequent D-positive pregnancies. However, methods modifying the RHD gene are in development, using programmable nucleases to convert D-positive erythroid lineage into D-negative in hope of protecting births (Kim et al, 2015).
